# Project #9: Medical Robotics
# Prototyping an Articulated Manipulator for Cervical Cancer Detection

● Modelled the robot manipulator using 3 spherical wrist joints and 1 prismatic joint to maximize geometric manipulability   
● Sketched the 3D kinematic diagram and parameterized the serial links according to the Denavit-Hartenberg convention  
● Derived the transformation matrices for the end-effector position and the Jacobian matrix via MATLAB's robotics toolbox
